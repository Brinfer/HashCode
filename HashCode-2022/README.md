## Practice Problem :pizza: :pizza: :pizza:

### [Problem description](practice_problem/practice_problem.pdf)

You are opening a small pizzeria. In fact, your pizzeria is __so__ small that you decided to offer only __one type of pizza__. Now you need to decide what ingredients to include (peppers? tomatoes? both?).

Everyone has their own pizza preferences. Each of your potential clients has some ingredients they like, and maybe some ingredients they dislike. Each client will come to your pizzeria if both conditions are true:

1. __all__ the ingredients they like are on the pizza, and
2. __none__ of the ingredients they dislike are on the pizza

Each client is OK with additional ingredients they neither like or dislike being present on the pizza. Your task is to choose which ingredients to put on your only pizza type, to maximize the number of clients that will visit your pizzeria.

A solution scores one point for each client that will come to your pizzeria. A client will come to your pizzeria if __all the ingredients they like__ are on the pizza and __none of the ingredients they dislike__ are on the pizza.
